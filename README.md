# CoverViolence
In this project, I implemented a scientific paper that discusses covering violent scenes in a movie with the help of a deep learning method or convolutional neural network.
The paper: https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/9/22/4963/htm#B21-applsci-09-04963

Through this paper, we developed a program that can scan every scene in the film and then identify each frame with 'safe' or 'unsafe' results.


To realize the deep learning model that can classify the image. We use the pre-trained model by Pytorch. With the transfer learning method, we improved the accuracy rate of our classification model to 90%.

We developed the program in 3 different parts: 
1. Preprocessing.
2. Fine Tuning Model Net.
3. Postprocessing.
