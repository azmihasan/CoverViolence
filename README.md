# CoverViolence
In this project, I and my friend implemented a scientific paper that discuss covering violence scene of movie with help of deep learning method or convolutional neural network.
The paper: https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/9/22/4963/htm#B21-applsci-09-04963

Through this paper, we were able to develop a program that can scan every scene in the film and then identify each frame with 'safe' or 'unsafe' results.


To realize the deep learning model which can classificate the image. We use the pretrained model by Pytorch. With the transfer learning method we were able to improve the accuracy rate of our classification model until 90%.

We developed the program in 3 different parts: 
1. Preprocessing.
2. Fine Tuning Model Net.
3. Postprocessing.
